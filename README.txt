An interactive marketplace for communal live experiences.

Everyone’s creating OTT. This is going to be the next generation of entertainment which people haven’t quite seen or billed for yet. It’s an over the top social media “Web 3.0” platform for immersive technology.

Stagemark is a marketplace for live interactive communal experiences based in the real and virtual worlds we all create together.
If we build something that can support multiple live AR performances in multiple locations, while supporting the exchange of NFT’s, and enabling artists to engage with fans in meaningful individualized, memorable ways unique to the AR/VR live performance experience; that would be something truly special don’t you think? We are currently developing AI tools to enable any electronic musician to live stream a performance and instantly transform streaming live audio into a multi media interactive immersive live performance. 

What if these Artificial Intelligent driven Augmented Reality performances were linked to virtual performance locations in order to also support a VR audience?

Live performance experiences broadcasted into virtual 3d environments synced with real world locations... these live experiences are simultaneously enhanced with AR technology and displayed in time and space synchronized and interlaced with the virtual environments on Stagemark. Virtual reality Users locations are synced with the real world locations. AR mobile users locations are synced with the virtual world locations. This juxtaposition and synchronization of virtual world with the real world creates strings that connect us all to each other no matter where we are on this planet. Stagemark is Wonderland. Stagemark allows people around the world to step “through the looking glass” and experience that world of wonder together.

Stagemark is focused on the needs of creators and there audiences.
We serve creators by giving them a safe place to perform and share there ideas and experiences with an audience of infinite size and scale in real and virtual places, limited only by the creators imagination and enhanced by the capability, opportunity and access of next gen technologies: An end to end live performance solution built for everyone.
